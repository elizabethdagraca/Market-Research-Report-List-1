<p><p>Car protective wax is divided into two main types: natural waxes and synthetic waxes. Natural waxes are derived from natural sources such as plants, beeswax, or carnauba palm trees. They offer a deeper, richer shine and are resistant to heat and water. On the other hand, synthetic waxes are man-made compounds that are designed to provide long-lasting protection for car surfaces. They are often cheaper than natural waxes and offer excellent durability and resistance to UV rays and harsh weather conditions. Both types of wax are commonly used to enhance and protect the exterior of cars.</p></p>
