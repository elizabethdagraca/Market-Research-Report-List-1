<p><h1>Boronate Affinity Chromatography Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Boronate Affinity Chromatography Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Boronate affinity chromatography (BAC) is a separation technique used for the selective binding and purification of biomolecules based on their affinity for boronate functional groups. It is widely used in the biopharmaceutical industry, particularly for the purification of glycoproteins, which contain sugar moieties that can form reversible complexes with boronate groups.</p><p>The principle behind BAC is the reversible binding of glycoproteins to boronate ligands under specific conditions, such as at physiological pH. In this technique, the boronate groups are immobilized onto a solid support matrix, such as agarose or silica beads, forming a boronate affinity resin. Samples containing the target glycoprotein are then passed through the column, allowing the glycoprotein to selectively bind to the boronate ligands. Impurities can be washed away, and the purified glycoprotein can be eluted using specific elution buffers.</p><p>The boronate affinity chromatography market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. The increasing demand for advanced separation techniques in the biopharmaceutical industry, coupled with the growing focus on protein therapeutics, is driving the adoption of boronate affinity chromatography. This technique offers several advantages, such as high selectivity, ease of use, and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale purification processes.</p><p>Moreover, technological advancements in the design of affinity resins, such as the development of high-capacity boronate resins, are further propelling market growth. These resins enhance the binding capacity and efficiency of the purification process. Additionally, the rising investments in research and development activities in the field of biotechnology, particularly in emerging economies, are fueling the demand for boronate affinity chromatography.</p><p>In conclusion, the boronate affinity chromatography market is expected to experience substantial growth with a CAGR of 14.5% during the forecast period. The increasing demand for advanced separation techniques, coupled with the development of high-capacity affinity resins, is driving the adoption of boronate affinity chromatography in the biopharmaceutical industry.</p></p>
