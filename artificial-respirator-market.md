<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Respirator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Pressure Type</li><li>Constant Volume Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Constant Pressure Type artificial respirators, also known as pressure-controlled devices, deliver a continuous airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle. These devices maintain a constant pressure during both inspiration and expiration, ensuring adequate oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. On the other hand, constant volume type artificial respirators, also called volume-controlled devices, maintain a constant volume of air delivered during each breath. These devices allow for precise control of tidal volume, ensuring consistent oxygenation and ventilation. Both types of respirators are crucial in providing life support for patients with respiratory insufficiency.</p></p>
