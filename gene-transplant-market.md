<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Transplant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene transplant market types can be broadly categorized into two categories: ex vivo and in vivo. In the ex vivo market, genetic material is extracted from the patient's cells, modified outside the body, and then reintroduced into the patient. This approach is commonly used in stem cell therapy and is effective for diseases with localized cell populations. In contrast, the in vivo market involves delivering and administering gene therapy directly inside the patient's body. This method is suitable for diseases that affect multiple body systems or require widespread genetic modification.</p></p>
