<p><strong>Tardive Dyskinesia Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) market is highly competitive, with several key players vying for market share. Three prominent companies in this space are Bausch Health (formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals), Neurocrine Biosciences, and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries.</p><p>Bausch Health is a leading pharmaceutical company with a diverse portfolio of products. The company has a strong presence in the TD market with its drug, Ingrezza (valbenazine). Ingrezza was the first-ever FDA-approved treatment for TD and has gained significant market share since its launch in 2017. Bausch Health has experienced rapid growth in the TD market due to the increasing prevalence of the condition and the lack of effective treatments prior to Ingrezza's approval. The company's focus on research and development, as well as strategic partnerships, positions it for further growth in the TD market.</p><p>Neurocrine Biosciences is another key player in the TD market. The company's flagship product, Austedo (deutetrabenazine), is approved for the treatment of TD. Austedo has demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing TD symptoms and has gained market traction since its launch in 2017. Neurocrine Biosciences is focused on expanding its TD market presence through clinical research and by leveraging its expertise in neurological disorders. The company's robust pipeline of innovative treatments indicates future growth potential in the TD market.</p><p>Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries is a multinational pharmaceutical company that also operates in the TD market. The company offers generic versions of drugs used to treat TD, including tetrabenazine. Teva's focus on affordability and accessibility of medications has garnered significant market share, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources. However, the company faces stiff competition from branded products like Ingrezza and Austedo, which offer improved efficacy and convenience. Teva's future growth in the TD market may rely on further expanding its product offerings and developing innovative therapies.</p><p>Exact sales revenue figures for these companies in the TD market are not readily available. However, it is estimated that Bausch Health's TD drug, Ingrezza, generated approximately $550 million in sales revenue in 2020. Neurocrine Biosciences' Austedo reported sales of around $478 million in the same year. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries' sales revenue from TD-related medications is not individually disclosed.</p><p>In conclusion, the TD market is fiercely competitive, with Bausch Health, Neurocrine Biosciences, and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries as key players. Ingrezza and Austedo have shown remarkable market growth and are expected to continue expanding due to their efficacy in treating TD symptoms. Bausch Health and Neurocrine Biosciences are well-positioned for future growth, whereas Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries faces challenges in maintaining its market share against branded competitors. Nonetheless, all three companies contribute significantly to the development of treatments for TD and are dedicated to improving the lives of patients affected by this condition.</p></p>
