<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stirling Refrigerators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integral type</li><li>Split type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Stirling refrigerators are available in two market types: integral and split. Integral type refers to a refrigerator unit that is self-contained and compact, often used in small spaces or for personal use. It combines the compressor, condenser, and evaporator in one unit. Split type, on the other hand, separates the components into two units: the indoor unit (evaporator) and the outdoor unit (compressor and condenser). This type is commonly found in larger spaces or commercial settings, allowing for more flexibility in installation and operation.</p></p>
