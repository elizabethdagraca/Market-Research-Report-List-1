<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pertussis Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whole-cell Vaccines</li><li>Acellular Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccines can be categorized into two types: whole-cell vaccines and acellular vaccines. Whole-cell vaccines consist of inactivated pertussis bacteria that stimulate the immune system to produce a response. However, they can cause side effects such as fever and pain. Acellular vaccines contain only a few components of the pertussis bacteria, which reduces the risk of side effects. They are considered safer but might have lower efficacy compared to whole-cell vaccines. Both types aim to prevent pertussis infection and its associated complications.</p></p>
