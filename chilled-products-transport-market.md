<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chilled Products Transport Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Compression Systems</li><li>Cryogenic Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chilled products transport market consists of two types of refrigeration systems: vapor compression systems and cryogenic systems. Vapor compression systems use compressors to circulate refrigerants, which absorb heat from the chilled products and release it outside the vehicle. On the other hand, cryogenic systems involve the use of extremely cold substances, such as liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide, to achieve low temperatures and maintain the quality and freshness of the transported goods. Both systems are widely used in the transportation of perishable goods, such as food and pharmaceuticals.</p></p>
