<p><h1>PCI Stents Market Size, Growth and Forecast from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>PCI Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>PCI stents, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention stents or coronary stents, are tiny wire mesh tubes used for treating narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. These stents are inserted into the arteries during a minimally invasive procedure called angioplasty to help improve blood flow and prevent future blockages. They provide structural support to the artery walls and keep them open.</p><p>The PCI stents market has been witnessing significant growth due to various factors. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, along with the growing geriatric population, has significantly contributed to market growth. Additionally, advancements in stent materials, design, and technologies have improved the efficiency and effectiveness of these devices, further fueling market growth.</p><p>Moreover, the rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures, such as angioplasty, over traditional open-heart surgeries, has increased the demand for PCI stents. These procedures offer benefits such as reduced hospital stays, faster recovery, and lower complications, thereby driving market growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the market is witnessing trends such as the introduction of bioresorbable stents, which are designed to gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the long-term presence of a permanent stent. This trend is gaining momentum as it reduces the risk of stent-related complications and allows for vessel restoration.</p><p>According to the forecast, the PCI stents market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in stent technologies, and the rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures. Moreover, the market is expected to witness further developments in bioresorbable stents, driving market expansion and innovation.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCI Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCI stents market consists of different types, including bare-metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES), and bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS). Bare-metal stents are made of metal and are placed in narrowed arteries during angioplasty. Drug-eluting stents are similar to BMS but release medication to prevent restenosis. Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds are made of biodegradable materials and gradually dissolve over time, allowing the artery to regain its natural function. These stent types provide different treatment options for patients with coronary artery disease, catering to their specific needs and conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>The PCI Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angina</li><li>Myocardial Infarction</li><li>Other Disease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCI stents are medical devices used to treat narrowing or blockages in the arteries of the heart. They are widely applied in various disease conditions, including angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and other cardiovascular diseases. Angina is characterized by severe chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, while myocardial infarction is a critical condition where a complete blockage of blood flow leads to damage of heart muscle. These stents provide a minimally invasive solution by expanding the artery walls, improving blood flow, and alleviating symptoms associated with these diseases.</p></p>
