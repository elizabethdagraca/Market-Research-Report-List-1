<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Solar Water Heater</li><li>Non Pressure Solar Water Heater</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The solar water heater market consists of two main types: pressurized and non-pressure solar water heaters. A pressurized solar water heater uses a pump to circulate the water through the system and into the storage tank, allowing for hot water to be readily available at any faucet. On the other hand, a non-pressure solar water heater relies on gravity to circulate the water, making it suitable for low-rise buildings and areas with low water pressure. Both types harness solar energy to heat water, providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for hot water needs.</p></p>
