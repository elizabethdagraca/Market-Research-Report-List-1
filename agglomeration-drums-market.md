<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agglomeration Drums Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agglomeration drums are used in industries for the purpose of agglomerating or granulating various materials. In the wet market, the drums operate with the presence of a liquid binder that helps in agglomeration. This type is preferred when dealing with materials that are difficult to agglomerate or require a specific moisture level. On the other hand, in the dry market, no liquid binder is utilized, and materials are agglomerated solely through mechanical means. This type is suitable for materials that can be granulated without the need for moisture or binders.</p></p>
