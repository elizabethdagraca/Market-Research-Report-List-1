<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Barrier Gate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight</li><li>Crank</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The vehicle barrier gate market includes two main types: straight gates and crank gates. Straight gates are the basic type that moves straight up and down to allow or block the passage of vehicles. They are commonly used in parking lots and toll booths. On the other hand, crank gates operate using a crank mechanism that lifts the gate arm in an arc-shaped motion, allowing for a wider clearance for larger vehicles. Crank gates are generally found in areas with heavy truck traffic, such as industrial sites and warehouses.</p></p>
