<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Ventilation Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fan</li><li>Axial Fan</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Residential ventilation fans are devices that circulate and exchange air in residential spaces. There are two main types of these fans available in the market - centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans work by drawing air into their blades and pushing it out at a perpendicular angle to the airflow. They are suitable for applications that require high-pressure airflow, such as kitchen exhaust systems. On the other hand, axial fans move air parallel to the axis of the fan blade rotation. They are commonly used for general ventilation and cooling purposes in residential buildings.</p></p>
