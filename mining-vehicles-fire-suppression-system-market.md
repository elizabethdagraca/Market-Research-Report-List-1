<p><strong>The Mining Vehicles Fire Suppression System Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Pit Mining</li><li>Underground Mining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mining vehicles fire suppression system market finds application in both open-pit mining and underground mining operations. Open-pit mining involves the extraction of minerals or materials from the earth's surface, requiring large-scale machinery and hence requiring fire suppression systems to mitigate risks. Underground mining involves extracting minerals or materials from beneath the earth's surface, where risk of fires breaking out due to flammable gases or materials is higher. Thus, fire suppression systems are crucial in both types of mining operations to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment.</p></p>
