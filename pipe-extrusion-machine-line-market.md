<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipe Extrusion Machine Line Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Screw Extruder</li><li>Twin Screw Extruder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pipe extrusion machine line market is classified into two types: single screw extruder and twin screw extruder. In a single screw extruder, a large screw is used to push the raw material through a heated barrel to create the desired pipe. This type is simpler and cost-effective for small-scale productions. On the other hand, a twin screw extruder has two interlocking screws that work together to efficiently and evenly mix and melt the material. This type is mainly used for larger and more complex pipe production processes. Both types serve the purpose of extruding pipes but cater to different production needs.</p></p>
