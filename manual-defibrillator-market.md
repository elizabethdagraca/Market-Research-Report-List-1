<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Defibrillator</li><li>Biphasic Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The manual defibrillator market consists of two main types: single-phase defibrillators and biphasic defibrillators. Single-phase defibrillators use a single waveform to deliver an electrical shock to the patient's heart in order to restore a normal rhythm. On the other hand, biphasic defibrillators use a bi-directional waveform that delivers a more effective shock with lower energy levels, reducing the potential damage to the heart. Both types are used in emergency situations to treat life-threatening cardiac conditions and restore normal heart rhythm.</p></p>
