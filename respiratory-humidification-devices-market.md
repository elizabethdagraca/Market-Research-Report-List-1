<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Humidification Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilation</li><li>High-Flow Nasal Cannula(HFNC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Respiratory humidification devices are used to add moisture to the respiratory system, preventing drying and irritation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of a ventilator to deliver oxygen directly into the lungs, typically through a breathing tube. Non-invasive ventilation provides respiratory support through a mask or nasal interface instead of a breathing tube. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) delivers heated and humidified oxygen at a high flow rate through a small tube inserted into the nostrils. These devices play a crucial role in assisting patients with respiratory conditions in breathing properly.</p></p>
