<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sand Blaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Blaster</li><li>Wet Blaster</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The sand blaster market is divided into two types: dry blasters and wet blasters. Dry blasters use compressed air to propel dry abrasive materials like sand at high speeds to remove paint or debris from surfaces. On the other hand, wet blasters mix water with abrasive materials before propelling them onto surfaces. Wet blasters are less abrasive but are effective for cleaning delicate surfaces without causing damage. Both types of sand blasters have their unique applications and benefits, depending on the specific requirements of the task at hand.</p></p>
