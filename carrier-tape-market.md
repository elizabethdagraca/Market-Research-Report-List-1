<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carrier Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Paper Core Carier Tape</li><li>Plastic Core Carier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Carrier tape is a packaging material used to store and transport electronic components. There are two main types of carrier tapes: paper core and plastic core. Paper core carrier tape consists of a paperboard core with a plastic film covering. It is lightweight and cost-effective but has lower durability. On the other hand, plastic core carrier tape is made entirely of plastic, providing better protection and durability. It is more suitable for delicate or sensitive components. Both types serve the purpose of securely holding electronic components during production and shipment.</p></p>
